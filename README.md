# Express Typescript Boilerplate [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/w3tecch/express-typescript-boilerplate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/w3tecch/express-typescript-boilerplate)

A delightful way to building a RESTful API with NodeJs & TypeScript.
- **Beautiful Syntax** thanks to the awesome annotations from [Inversify Express Utils](https://github.com/inversify/inversify-express-utils).
- **Easy API Testing** with included black-box testing.
- **Dependency Injection** done with the nice framework from [Inversify](http://inversify.io/).
- **Fast Database Building** with simple migration and seeding from [Knex](http://knexjs.org/).
- **Simplified Database Query** with the ORM of [Knex](http://knexjs.org/) called [Bookshelf](http://bookshelfjs.org/).
- **Clear Structure** with controllers, services, repositories, models, middlewares...
- **Easy Exception Handling** with our own simple classes. You will see.
- **Easy Data Seeding** with our own factories.
- **Custom Commands** are also available in our setup and really easy to use.
- **Smart Validation** thanks to [class-validator](https://github.com/pleerock/class-validator) with some nice annotations.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
* Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
    * on OSX use [homebrew](http://brew.sh) `brew install node`
    * on Windows use [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) `choco install nodejs`
* Install yarn globally `npm install yarn -g`

## Installing
* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `yarn install` to install all dependencies and typings
* Create new database. You will find the name in the .env files.
* `npm run db:migrate` to create the schema
* `npm run db:seed` to insert some test data
* `npm run serve` to start the dev server in another tab

## Running the app
After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app.
Run `npm run serve` to start a local server using `nodemon` which will watch for changes and then will restart the sever.
The port will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000` (or if you prefer IPv6, if you're using `express` server, then it's `http://[::1]:3000/`).

## Scripts / Commands
### Install
* Install all dependencies with `yarn install`

### Linting
* Run code analysis using `npm run lint`. This runs tslint.
* There is also a vscode task for this called lint.

### Tests
* Run the unit tests using `npm test`.
* Run the black-box tests using `npm run test:black-box` and don't forget to start your application and your [Auth0 Mock Server](https://github.com/hirsch88/auth0-mock-server).
* There is also a vscode task for this called test.

### Running in dev mode
* Run `npm run serve` to start nodemon with ts-node, which will serve your app.
* The server address will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000`

### Cleaning the project
* Run `npm run clean` to remove all generated JavaScript files.

### Building the project and run it
* Run `npm run build` to generated all JavaScript files from your TypeScript sources. After this step you can deploy the app on any server.
* There is also a vscode task for this called build.
* To start the builded app use `npm start`.

### Database
* Run `npm run db:migrate` to migration the new schema to the database
* Run `npm run db:migrate:rollback` to rollback one version
* Run `npm run db:seed` to seed some data into the database
* Run `npm run db:reset` to clean the database and migrate again

### Console
* To run your own created cli script enter `npm run console <command-name>`
